Data import (:mod:`heliopy.data`)
---------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: heliopy.data

Methods for automatically importing data to python. Each spacecraft has its
own sub-module:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ace
   artemis
   cassini
   cluster
   helios
   imp
   messenger
   mms
   omni
   ulysses
   wind

Each mission does not have a complete set of data import methods, but the goal
of HelioPy is to be as complete as possible. If you want to import a data set
that is not yet supported please open an issue on the bug tracker at
https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy/issues

There are also modules for downloading SPICE kernels and sunspot number
data:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   spice
   sunspot

a module with helper functions that apply generally to all data is available:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   helper

and utility functions that much of the data import uses are also available in the
util module:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   util

SunPy and AstroPy Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HelioPy is built to be used alongside SunPy and AstroPy. Before v0.6, HelioPy returned
a Pandas DataFrame object. After implementation of physical units into the data, HelioPy
returns a SunPy TimeSeries object. The TimeSeries object is capable of storing data like Pandas DataFrame,
with added benefit of being used alongside AstroPy units.

SunPy Documentation is available at http://docs.sunpy.org/
You can also read more about `TimeSeries <http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/data_types/timeseries.html>`_

AstroPy Documentation is available at http://docs.astropy.org/
You can also read more about `Units <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/>`_

An example on how to use TimeSeries Data and AstroPy Units is also available in the Examples section:
